<h2>New Version on 12/4/2013<</h2>

Bugs Fixed:

* Bug in Smith-waterman-Gotoh alignment (The +/- sign on the penalty for the gap creation and extension was switched, leading to incorrect alignments)
* Bug in barcode assigner â€“ barcodes within hamming distance of 1 were not being assigned.

Improvements:

* Changed command line executable name to freqout
* Trimmed long sequences to within only 10 bp longer than the expected read to improve alignment speed and accuracy
* Increased hashing k-mer length to 9 to reduce the number of alignment candidates identified
* Automatically skipping reads less than 75 bp (minimum length can be set in XML).
* Output column names changed
